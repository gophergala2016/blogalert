Blogalert crawls blog sites and alerts you when a subscription has new content

It is devided into a crawler, an api and a frontend. All of these can be hosted seperatly as long as they share a database.

## TODO

* Unsubscribe (in progess)
* URL autocomplete
* Blacklist so people cant crawl sites like twitter (there is already a time limit on crawling a site)
* Preproccess unread articles

## Wishlist

 * Content extraction using diff
 * Search tool to find intersting articles
 * Analytics to procuce a trending section
 * Notifications (email/push)
